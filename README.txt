things learned from this project:

1. never knew about debugging on browsers;
2. still mystery about where and when to triggar things happen when it needs to, but following the video feels like there's a huge gap between a good coder and me.
3. keep styling consistent.
4. was able to implement everything required except I don't know how does showLocation supposed to work, why does it come with an onclick value. In my mind you shouldn't have to pass anything in for this function because all the information you need is already given in the onclick value. so I wrote showLocation function but I don't know how to make it work.

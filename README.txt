things learned from 1b:

-was able to fix all the left over problems from 1a,
-and researched a bunch and still haven't figure out how to make the jQuery animations work.
-it was great to have some time in the class where you were able to help the students, however I wasn't ready for the questions, I wish I can stop being procrastinating things.

things learned from this project:

1. never knew about debugging on browsers;
2. still mystery about where and when to triggar things happen when it needs to, but following the video feels like there's a huge gap between a good coder and me.
3. keep styling consistent.
4. was able to implement everything required except I don't know how does showLocation supposed to work, why does it come with an onclick value. In my mind you shouldn't have to pass anything in for this function because all the information you need is already given in the onclick value. so I wrote showLocation function but I don't know how to make it work.

things learned from 1b:

-was able to fix all the left over problems from 1a,
-and researched a bunch and still haven't figure out how to make the jQuery animations work.
-it was great to have some time in the class where you were able to help the students, however I wasn't ready for the questions, I wish I can stop being procrastinating things.
